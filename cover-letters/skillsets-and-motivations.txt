        1. Contribute desireable, feasible and reliable design artefacts and strategy to the vision of the Frontend experience

        2. Be a key driver in a companies design system for their products

        3. Feature iteration through one week design sprints

    Detailed Version

        1. Contribute desireable, feasible and reliable design artefacts and strategy to the vision of the Frontend experience
            Unpacking User Feedback
            Reframing customer and business objectives through user interface mockups

        2. Be a key driver in a companies design system for their products
            Present design decisions through tangible research that's communicated effectively (personas)

        3. Feature iteration through one week design sprints 
            One week from concept to validated designs is the aim.

                https://paulminors.com/blog/sprint-jake-knapp-book-summary-pdf/ | Paul Minor's review

        4. Access to Mental Health, specifically Youth Mental Health services for all Australians
            In a developed country like Australia, this seems like the fulcrum to tackle the world's toughest problems. 
            If we all get the opportunity to be our best selves, we can forge a brighter future.

        5. Using good products and services to make as many people in the world as rich as possible as fast as possible.
            People with ample access to the things they want and need are autonomous, self actualised people. 
            Most self actualised people want to save the world. 
            Saving the world is much easier with a team. 
            It's also a lot more fun.

        2. Teaching
            I teaching students about
                doing user research
                making personas
                UI sketching, wireframes and mockups

        3. Double Diamond Design
            discovery
                researching a space to find out what we know 
                reveal things we didn't think the ask
            definition
                refine the problem statement and success metrics (business objectives)
                do this using technical, business and user constraints 
            develop
                create sketches, wireframes and mockups that solve the problem statement
            deliver
                conduct usability with prototypes of various fidelities 
                decide on the prototypes that balance feasibility, reliability and desireability
                deliver these to developers with user stories and design artefacts

        4. User testing
            establishing learning goals
                reframe assumptions about the user experience in a way that reveals what users actually want
            setting up questions 
                get valuable data from users 
                limit complexity
                maintain engagement
                don't let answers get clouded by negative mindsets
            a/b testing
                for prototype testing, have simple comparisons between designs to get clear answers from users
            card sorting
                for conceptual testing, create heirarchies of ideas with users to establish priorities for user experience and better understand how users percieve the concept and language involved with a product.
            Software
                askable, dovetail, usertesting, userzoom, lookback

        5. Desk Research
            Thematic analysis 
                for large amounts of qualitative data, find themes to provide direction at a strategic level.
            Statistical ethnography
                use statistical data and laws of behavioural economics to frame assumptions around a product
            Personas
                use hypothetical archetypes to drive conversation around the desireability of functionality.
                combine multiple personas to understand broad desires for what products should be 
                    use this understanding to inform product strategy and service design.

        6. User Interface Design

            Working within existing design systems to provide users 
                desireable functionality that is quick to build 
                easy to maintain.
            Pixel Perfect Design
                using symbols and systems to automate detail management as much as possible 
                in times where that's not possible, doing the grind to make things pixel perfect for engineers.
                from experince, the clearer the design vision, the easier it is to code.
                UI design is like comedy. if you need to explain it, it doesn't work.
            Bend, break and recreate the product rules when we need to. 
                bring things back to the laws of UX 
                    e.g. Aesthetic-usability effect, Doherty threshold, Pareto Principle, Occam's Razor, Golden Ratio
                consider the effect of design patterns on user experience based on best practice
                    e.g. typography, colour theory, objects in space (2 or 3 dimensional space cartesian space, objects in hyperbolic space)
            Software: Figma, Sketch, Abstract, Adobe Suite

        7. Design Systems and Brand Stories

            knowledge articles and design pattern specs for everyone across the team to quickly access and include existing patterns in their work.
            basing systems on brand stories.
            establishing typography and colour systems that reflect core values of a brand story.
            using hypothetical archetypes like a community of personas to build brand stories.
            establishing processes that make contribution to design systems simple for designers and developers.
            creating templates for additions that capture the research leading to design choices and decisions.
                
        8. Workshops
            Facilation
                Planning timed activities  
                everyones ideas into a format to define what success looks like and drive improvement in a defined scope.
            Software 
                Miro (online white-board)


        9. Presentation and Pitching
            Animation
                add depth and visual artefacts for storytelling to make meaning and ideas more accessible.
            Software
